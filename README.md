# 🤖 Building a Custom AI Assistant Web App

Development of a domain-specific AI assistant using Streamlit, Gemini API, and RAG-based document querying. The project culminates in a deployed web application capable of intelligent conversation, tool execution, and document Q&A.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project aims to apply advanced AI development techniques to deliver:

- **Conversational AI Web App**: A deployed Streamlit application with Gemini API integration and custom function-calling tools.
- **Domain-Specific Tool Suite**: AI-powered utilities tailored to a real-world use case (e.g., study buddy, travel planner, business assistant).
- **RAG-Enabled Knowledge System**: Intelligent document upload and querying using embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation.

## 🚀 How to Run a *Streamlit* App

### 🧩 Steps

1. **Activate the environment**

    On Windows: 
    ```bash
    project-env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source project-env/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Run *Streamlit* app**

    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

    Starts the *Streamlit* server and launches your app in the browser (usually at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/)).

---

### 💡 Tips

- To stop the app, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal.
- To check your *Streamlit* version:

    ```bash
    streamlit --version
    ```

## 🧪 Git Workflow Guide

Follow these steps to collaborate smoothly with your team:

### 🔀 Step 1: Check your current branch

Before you start working, verify which branch you're on:

```bash
git branch
```
If you're already on your personal branch, proceed to Step 2. If not, switch to your branch:

```bash
git checkout your-branch-name
```
### 🔄 Step 2: Sync with the shared branch
Before you start working, pull the latest changes from the shared branch:
```bash
git pull origin shared-branch-name
```
Now you're ready to work!

### 💾 Step 3: Save and push your changes
When you're done working:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
### 🔁 Step 4: Update the shared branch
After pushing your changes, merge them into the shared branch:
```bash
git checkout shared-branch-name
git pull origin shared-branch-name
git merge your-branch-name
git push origin shared-branch-name
```

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

The app will be deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

- Ensure proper environment setup using `venv` and `requirements.txt`  
- Monitor app performance and document all deployment steps  
- Include deployment instructions in the final report and repository  
- Use Streamlit’s sharing and access controls to manage visibility
