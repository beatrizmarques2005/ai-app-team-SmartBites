## 📋 Overview

*SmartBites* is a **personalized meal planning web application** designed to help university students manage meals despite busy and unpredictable schedules. Many students face repetitive meals, inefficient ingredient usage, and food waste due to limited time and lack of planning. *SmartBites* solves this by providing **practical, AI-driven meal plans and recipe suggestions** based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and available cooking time.

Key features include:

* **AI-Powered Meal Planning**: Generates weekly meal suggestions adapted to user preferences, pantry contents, and time constraints.
* **Conversational Assistant**: Streamlit-based chatbot using the **Google *Gemini* API** to suggest recipes and assist with meal planning interactively.
* **Smart Pantry & Shopping Management**: Tracks ingredients, updates pantry items from receipts, and manages shopping lists to minimize waste.
* **Secure User Data Handling**: Authentication and per-user data persistence through ***Supabase***, keeping meal plans, pantry items, and shopping lists safe.
* **Interactive & Intuitive Experience**: Easy-to-use interface for planning meals, cooking assistance, and grocery management.

By combining **AI-driven reasoning** and a **friendly interactive interface**, *SmartBites* makes meal planning **fast, flexible, and stress-free** for students who want to cook efficiently and avoid food waste.
